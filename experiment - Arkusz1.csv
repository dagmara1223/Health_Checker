Iritiated? Who knows maybe a bit of everything. I feel sad because i got into an argument with my beatufiul girlfriend, and i kinda feel tired  after today, both physically and mentally. Also weather today sucks:(  I want to hug my girlfirend. At 20:27 feelings of accomplishment because of my first succesfull lesson. Also feelings of worry about my girlfriend. When she is not talking that much i always assume she is either mad at me, sad becuase of something or really tired. Either of those things are bad and i want my little angel to feel good. ",
